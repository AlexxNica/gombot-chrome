newsletter boolean isn't working properly
do we need to firstRun thing anyway? Maybe only show the signup page after install?
Gombot button doesn't do anything
need to scroll on error in signup
if passwords don't match, then you can't seem to proceed
need a timestamp during create?
need to fix copy about master password reset on signup success page
get server sync going
    // seed entropy
  // client.context({}, function(err, data) {
  //   client.timeOffset = (new Date()/1000 >>> 0) - data.server_time;
  // });
figure out a cool dynamic origin merging process
  - for example, "we have creds for x.example.com, would you like to use them on y.example.com"
figure out what is going on with all the citi domains (need my account reset)
www.bankofamerica.com and safe.bankofamerica.com for linking especially
  - make captured credentials storage respect realms
handle email already in use error on signup
test intranet domains
test ip address sites with ports
handle the capturing of other password managers form filling (maybe do setTimout afer form has been recognized and try to do some intelligent capture of the credentials)
  - handled by setTimeout(grab shit if don't have any) in passwordForm?
figure out sessions for client (browser session, explicit logout?)
need busy indicator on login page
fix update_password in infobar_hooks.js
figure out downloadExportDataFile function (does it work, is it exposed?)
login success goes to successful install page
seems to be race condition with citi realm (problems with capturing on accountonline.com and filling on https://creditcards.citi.com/)

HTTP auth capture/fill
capturing and filling lone password fields
tdameritrade may need some type like a human for lone password field on transfer page
AJAX login: https://www.select-a-spot.com
bayareacurling has annoying change password page

consider supporting grabbing username from select elements (online.citibank.com when remember me is enabled). This site also has a dynamic username box when you say log in as another user
