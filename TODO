ALPHA BLOCKERS
- package extension
- terms and policy broken on signup page
- fix copy after you login (it says "successfully installed")
- need to fix copy about master password reset on signup success page to make it reflect reality
- date is wrong on copy in successful install page
- test domains, all special cases, maybe an IP domain, maybe an intranet domain, something with ports
- test getsatisfaction
- should do something if the case of unhandled server errors on signup and signin pages
- figure out API URL for different releases

Backbone.sync refactor
 - make user model only handle unencrypted data
 - introduce GombotSyncMediator to coordinate GombotSync and LocalSync
 - create a proxy User object in GombotSyncMediator to handle toJSON() and parse() of encrypted user blobs
 - remove localStorage flag on UserCollection
 - have User.fetch() return encrypted nothing if not authenticated
 - implement User.isAuthenticated() { return this.client && this.client.isAuthenticated() }

return immediately any available creds before user.fetch() when we detect login forms

need to scroll on error in signup


figure out a cool dynamic origin merging process
  - for example, "we have creds for x.example.com, would you like to use them on y.example.com"

figure out what is going on with all the citi domains (need my account reset)

www.bankofamerica.com and safe.bankofamerica.com for linking especially
  - make captured credentials storage respect realms

handle the capturing of other password managers form filling (maybe do setTimout afer form has been recognized and try to do some intelligent capture of the credentials)
  - handled by setTimeout(grab shit if don't have any) in passwordForm?

figure out downloadExportDataFile function (does it work, is it exposed?)

seems to be race condition with citi realm (problems with capturing on accountonline.com and filling on https://creditcards.citi.com/)

HTTP auth capture/fill
capturing and filling lone password fields
tdameritrade may need some type like a human for lone password field on transfer page
AJAX login: https://www.select-a-spot.com
bayareacurling has annoying change password page

consider supporting grabbing username from select elements (online.citibank.com when remember me is enabled). This site also has a dynamic username box when you say log in as another user
