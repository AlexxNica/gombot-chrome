Gombot Client (Chrome)
----------------------

These are the browser extensions for Gombot, an new experimental cross-platform password manager from Mozilla.

The top level directory includes the manifest.json for the Chrome extension, while the /Firefox directory contains the beginnings of a Firefox add-on that can be run with the [https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/](add-on SDK). In the future, it will be moved to a separate repository.

For more information on packaging and running this extension in Chrome, see [http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging.html](this page).

Setup
-----

Make sure to check out submodules (` git submodule update --init `) before running.
