Gombot Client (Firefox)
----------------------

These are the browser extensions for Gombot, an new experimental cross-platform password manager from Mozilla.

This directory contains the beginnings of a Firefox add-on that can be run with the [https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/](add-on SDK). In the future, it will be moved to a separate repository.

For more information on packaging and running this extension in Firefox, see the docs for the [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/1.11/](add-on sdk).
